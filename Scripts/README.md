# Project Scripts

## Descriptions
1. `mean_fourier.py` computes the mean fast fourier transform of orbits from a particular `rescomp` system.

## Data
1. `lorenz_mean_fourier.npy` contains the mean fft of 200 10,000 second orbits on the Lorenz attractor
2. `rossler_mean_fourier.npy` contains the mean fft of 50 10,000 second orbits on the Lorenz attractor (Less orbits ecause it's frequency spectrum is less noisy than the Lorenz spectrum)
